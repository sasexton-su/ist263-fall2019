                    <h2>@ All Times</h2>
                    <p>
                            The idea for this double headed magazine was created through multiple mind-maps and trips to barnes and nobles. 
                            Eventually, I  finalized  At all times, a travel magazine with the day & night life of cities around the world.  
                            I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to showcase my illustration skills, so all of the illustrations 
                            you can see in this magazine were done by yours truly!

                        <h2>Equality Now</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Process of the Equality Now website started with style exploration, infographic creation, and finally web design. 
                            I focused on user experience and simplifying complex information to be understood by a specified audience. 
                            After solidifying my message and audience, I was able to distinguish  what information I wanted to visually represent. 
                            Using one of six different types of graphs, I outlined what I wanted to create and started iterations. 
                            Here, you can see six of the infographics that help to display different costs of being a woman, including the wage gap, gender taxed items, and period costs.
                            Using a 1140 px grid fit to a 1280px monitor, I laid out web pages to present my infographics in an interesting way, modifying them for web. 
                            I wanted to focus on how scroll could emphasize them and how if affects the  user experience. 
                            After creating the full web mock-up, I translated the pages to a mobile size so that it could be viewed in both ratios.
