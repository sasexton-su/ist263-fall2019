Hello! I’m Sloane Sexton and I’m currently a junior at Syracuse University studying Communications Design. If you don’t know what that is, I like to call it “graphic design with pizzazz!” I could list off all of my hobbies, like painting and drawing, but I believe that they’re all a part of what it means to be a designer. I try to live every day as a designer and remain conscious to how every choice I make can be a purposeful design choice. From what you wear to what you eat, we’re all just the designers of our own lives, right?
