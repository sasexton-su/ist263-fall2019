The idea for this double headed magazine was created through multiple mind-maps and trips to barnes and nobles. Eventually,   I  finalized  At all times, a travel magazine with the day & night life of cities around the world.  I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to showcase my illustration skills, so all of the illustrations you can see in this magazine were done by yours truly!
