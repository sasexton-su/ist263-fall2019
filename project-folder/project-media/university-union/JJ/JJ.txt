As the Design Director of University Union, I had the opportunity to develop a brand for our fall music festival, Juice Jam. This year the event featured 21 Savage, Earthgang, Fletcher, Mt. Joy, and Kilo Kish, along with multiple brand activations and a silent disco. Deliverables included the poster itself, many social posts, give away t-shirts and hats, staff shirts, and a snapchat filter. After working on these designs for months, it was incredible to see it all come together the day of the event.
