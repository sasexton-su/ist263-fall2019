        <p> 
        For my Individual project, I would like to create a portfolio for myself of just a few of my favorite projects. For my pages, I would have
        <dl>
            <dt> A Homepage </dt>
                <dd> This would serve as an about me page </dd>
            <dt> Two pages of my work</dt>
                <dd> One for my in-class design work and one for <abbr title="University Union">UU</abbr></dd>
        </dl> 
        </p>
        <p>
        I thought that this would be a strong idea to ensure all of the photos and work on the site is my own.
