    <p> I am a junior at Syracuse University studying Communications Design with a minor in Informations Management and Technology. Originally, I am from Center Valley, PA, which is about 3.5 hours from campus. Right now I live off campus with 9 of my friends, four of them also in the i-school and two of them in design! </p>
    <p> At Syracuse, I am involved in many things to help me build my portfolio. Syracuse's Production Board, University Union, is probably my favorite thing to be involved in. I am the Design Director, and manage a team of 6 designers. I love being able to create posters for the big names who come to campus, and seeing my work all around the school. </p>
